lyCompiler
==========

A very simple program that speeds up the process of compiling Lilypond files and reduces the amount of window changing needed.

Requires Python 2.7, and runs from terminal/command line only. Since the program's so mindblowingly simple, I hope to make a Python 3.x version and a GUI version available soon.

Why was it created?
----------
lyCompiler was created because I was working on Lilypond syntax, and needed a quick way to re-compile a file as efficiently as possible. I found switching windows or typing on the command line too cumbersome, and wanted a quick way to do the thing. As I have problems running lilypond.exe (it refuses to compile) and prefer to have the log output handy, I decided writing a custom program was best. I chose Python because it's easy and open-source.

(Note: I am far from a proeficiant programmer, and the way the program's been written probaly shows this.)
